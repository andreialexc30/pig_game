<h1>About the project</h1>
This is a browser based dice game that can be played alone or in two players.
<h2>Description</h2>
This an easy to play dice game. The objective is to roll the die until you reach 100 points, the players can also set up a custom final score value if they want. A player can hold their score after each roll, then it becomes the other player's turn. The player can roll the die as many times as they want in order to build up score, although there are a few penalties. If a player rolls a 1, all his round score is lost. If a player rolls a 6 on both die then his score is reset. The first player to reach a score of 100 points wins.
<h2>Information</h2>
This game was made as a part of Jonas Schmedtman's <em>The Complete JavaScript Course 2020 Build Real Projects!</em> on Udemy. The HTML&CSS for this project weren't made by me! I have only worked on the JS code.
<h2>What I've learned</h2>
Overall, Jonas Schmedtman's course helped me understand JavaScript better and it is my personal favorite option after freeCodeCamp's curriculum. His course helped me understand the JavaScript basics (variabales, basic operators, if/else statements, functions, arrays, and so on). This project though how JS works in the browser, it helped me understand DOM manipulation, events and event handling and how everything connects together.
